## Hello!

I am a junior at Carnegie Mellon studying Computer Science and Fine Art with a minor in Animation and Special Effects.

I believe that similar to identity, artistic practice is never static; my work is multidimensional, always evolving, and aims to capture the intersections of contemporary art and rapidly-changing technology. Some materials I work with combine CS and art such as 3D animation and creative coding, and some do not at all, such as photography, painting, and filmmaking.
