I am a fourth-year student in the Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts (BCSA) program at Carnegie Mellon University, studying Computer Science and Art. Being in this unique position between disciplines, I enjoy being in conversation with artists, researchers, engineers, and anyone who feels like they fall somewhere in between.
