Currently, I work at º1824, Universal Music Group’s in-house creative solutions team. My past clients include Meta, Pinterest, Kid Cudi, and Capitol Records. I'm in my final year at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts (BCSA) in Computer Science and Art, and seeking full-time opportunities starting Fall 2026.
