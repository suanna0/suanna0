Currently, I am studying Computer Science and Fine Art with a minor in Animation and Special Effects at Carnegie Mellon University. My work has been commissioned by Meta/Facebook, Pinterest, Common Sense Media, and Dehancer.

In my independent artistic practice, Iâ€™m driven by a need to explore complex aspects of identity, using code as a medium. Outside of my art, I love to collaborate with creatives and use my technical skills in CS to not only give insight to the limitations of technology, but also bring those projects to life.  
  
There are infinite permutations of combining art and CS, and whether its web development, knitting, creative coding, time-based media, or translating computer processes into analog form with my paintings, I embrace the cyclical nature of my interests and explore those possibilities, one by one. In the pursuit of my goal to explore these disciplines, I love being in constant conversation with artists, engineers, and people like me who feel that they lie somewhere in between the spectrum. In particular, one-on-one conversations are the most valuable to me: I love talking to artists about their own practices and I deeply cherish the intimate process of artistic collaboration.
